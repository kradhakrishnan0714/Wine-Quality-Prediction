# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## Objective 

1.	Build a predictive model that minimizes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set.
2.	Analyze the data to uncover key factors that contribute to high-quality wine, providing actionable insights for vintners to enhance their production processes.

## Deliverables
